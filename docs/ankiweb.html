<b>COMPATIBILITY</b>

Anki 2.1.20 or higher is required for this add-on to work.

Cards created with this add-on can be reviewed with all Computer and mobile apps and on AnkiWeb.

<b>USAGE</b>

<b>Creating / Editing</b>

The note type is automatically added the first time you start Anki after installing the add-on.

When creating cards, write a &quot;1&quot; for correct choices or a &quot;0&quot; for incorrect choices in the &quot;Answers&quot; field.
These values in the &quot;Answer&quot; field must be separated by a single space.
The order and number of values in the &quot;Answer&quot; field must correspond with the choices &quot;Q_1&quot; to &quot;Q_5&quot;.
If you don&#39;t need all the choices, just leave the remaining &quot;Q_&quot; fields blank and only enter as many values as you need in the &quot;Answers&quot; field.

<b>Reviewing</b>

Select the correct and incorrect choices accordingly and click &quot;Show Answer&quot;.
The add-on will automatically style your choices based on whether you answered correctly or not.

Great work Simon!

<a href="https://github.com/Schlauer-Hax">Hax</a> merged my Multiple Choice card template with Simon Lammer&#39;s persistence code.
He also reworked my card templates into one single all-in-one template.
Thanks a lot!

Simon's and Hax's work made the multiple choice cards compatible with all platforms.
